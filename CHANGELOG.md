## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-04

### Changed

- Migrated WebSocket implementation from `websockets` to `aiohttp` for improved performance and compatibility.
- Centralized and standardized error response handling using `error_utils`.

### Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `client.close_connection()`, `client.transcribe_local_file()`, and `client.transcribe_remote_url()` no longer return values directly.  
  üîÅ Instead, responses are sent via the event listener mechanism.
- Event system now supports **only one listener per event type**.  
  Registering a new listener for an event will **overwrite** the previous one.
